            <p>The founders of Gotham erected more than buildings — they laid foundations for obedience and control.
                It was then the Court took root, shaping every corner of the city’s future.</p>

        <div class="event">
            <span class="year">1800s</span>
            <p>Industrial titans rose, and so did their debts to the Court.
                The Owls directed fortunes, silenced dissenters, and curated history itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <span class="year">1900s</span>
            <p>In the shadow of wars and madness, we remained unseen.
                While Gotham’s skyline reached higher, our influence ran deeper.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
            <span class="year">Present</span>
            <p>As the world digitizes its secrets, so too has the Court adapted.
                Every whisper, every keystroke, every watchful camera feeds our gaze.</p>
